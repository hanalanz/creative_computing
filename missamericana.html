You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at 16, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life 

No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" 
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince 
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)


No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but


It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" 
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince 
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to Go
I don't really wanna Fight
'Cause nobody's gonna Win

And I don't want you to Go
I don't really wanna Fight
'Cause nobody's gonna Win

I think you should come home

And I'll never let you Go 
'cause I know this is a Fight
That someday we're gonna Win

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
Oh, I just thought you should know 
It's you and me, there's nothing like this 
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince 
We're so sad, we paint the town blue )
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to Go 
I don't really wanna Fight
'Cause nobody's gonna Win 

I think you should come home

And I'll never let you Go 
'cause I know this is a Fight
That someday we're gonna Win 

just thought you should know

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
"She's a bad, bad girl"
